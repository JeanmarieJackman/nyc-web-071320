# Active Record Basics

## Questions
- 

## Why Active Record?
- SQL is used to communicate with DBs
- ORM an app that writes SQL statements for us
- AR is an ORM 
  - Call a method on the class object or instance object
  - AR will use the method called to execute a SQL statement
  - AR makes a lot of assumptions
    - which applies a lot of rules

## From OO to Active Record

- Review Tables
- Rake & Migrations
- Models 


If I make a table I SHOULD  make a class 
If I make a class I ONLY make a table if I want to persist information 

persist == save 

Classes/Models
 - OO Ruby to manage

 Tables/DB
 - Rake & Migrations
